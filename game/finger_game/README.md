Two players expose one finger to each hand.
# Rule 1
The starting player A hits the other player with one hand.
Player B adds modulo five the number of fingers of the two hands that have come into contact and displays the result on the affected hand
It's up to player B, he chooses the hand with which to attack between his two, and chooses the hand to attack between the two of the opponent.
Player A adds modulo five the number of fingers on his hands that have come into contact and keeps the result by displaying it on his hand.

# Rule 2
When, adding form five, one of the two players gets zero, he loses the hand.
When a player loses both hands, he loses the game

# Rule 3
When a player has only one hand with an even number, 2 or 4, he can split the amount between the two hands. And his shift ends with this.
